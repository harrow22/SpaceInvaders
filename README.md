# SpaceInvaders ðŸ‘¾
This is an emulator of the 1978 Taito arcade machine, [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), with color and sound! It runs on top of my [Intel8080 core](https://github.com/harrow22/Intel8080).

# Controls
* `C` to add credits
* `1` or `2` to start the game in one or two player 
* `space` to shoot
* `left arrow key` to move left
* `right arrow key` to move right
* `T` to tilt

# Installation
I've provided installers on the [releases](https://github.com/harrow22/SpaceInvaders/releases) page. After installation, you will need to add the [ROMs](assets/roms) and [sound files](assets/sound) to the assets folder. Then to run the emulator, simply click on the `.exe`.

### Changing the behavior of the emulator
1) You will need to launch the emulator from the terminal. Use the following command:
   ```
   path/to/Intel8080.exe <PARAMETERS>
   ```
2) In place of `<PARAMETERS>`, you can add the following to the program:
   * `-lives <NUMBER in range [3,6]>` - changes the number of lives you start with (default is 3).
   * `-extra_life <1500 or 1000>` - changes the amount of points needed to gain an extra life (default is 1500).
> [!NOTE]
> For example, if I wanted to start the game with 5 lives instead of 3, I would run: `'~\Downloads\Intel 8080 Emulator\bin\SpaceInvaders.exe' -lives 5`.

## Building from Source
### Dependencies
* **A c++ compiler**
* **CMake version 3.26+**
* **CMake build generator**
* **[SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)**
* **[SDL_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer)**

### With CMake
1) Download the source code
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harrow22/SpaceInvaders.git
    cd SpaceInvaders
    ```
2) Add the [ROMs](assets/roms) and [sound files](assets/sound) to the assets folder.
3) **Optional:** If you want, you can customize the color of the emulator by changing the color code constants defined in [Display.h](src/components/Display.h).  
4) Build
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -G <generator> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <path/to/sdl>
    cd build
    cmake --build . --config Release
    cmake --install . --config Release --prefix <path/to/install_location>/SpaceInvadersEmulator/
    ```
5) Run the executable
